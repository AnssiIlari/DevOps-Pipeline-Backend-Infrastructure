## Introduction

**Project Goal**: Demonstrate how to configure, deploy, and maintain a containerized application infrastructure on an Ubuntu VPS using Docker, Jenkins, and Nginx—all while leveraging Cloudflare for DNS and SSL management.

**Why It Matters**: Modern web applications require secure, continuous delivery. This repository highlights a real-world DevOps pipeline, from code commits and automated tests to staging and production deployments.

---

- **Ubuntu VPS**: Hosts the entire environment, providing a secure and stable foundation.  
- **Docker Containers**: Each microservice or application runs in its own container for easy maintenance and scalability.  
- **Nginx**: Acts as a reverse proxy to route incoming requests to the appropriate container.  
- **Cloudflare**: Manages DNS, SSL certificates, and security features like DDoS protection.

---

## Tech Stack

1. **Ubuntu (VPS)**
   - Base operating system for running Docker, Jenkins, and other services.
2. **Docker**
   - Containerization platform for packaging and deploying applications.
3. **Jenkins**
   - CI/CD tool for automated builds, testing, and deployment.
4. **Nginx**
   - Reverse proxy for managing and routing HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the correct Docker containers.
5. **Cloudflare**
   - DNS, SSL, and security layers for public-facing traffic.
6. **Security Tools** (e.g., **Fail2ban**, **UFW**)
   - Firewall and intrusion prevention on the VPS.

---

## Security Measures

- **Firewall (UFW)**: Restricts incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.  
- **Fail2ban**: Monitors logs and bans IPs that exhibit malicious activity.  
- **OS Patching**: Regular updates to Ubuntu to address vulnerabilities.  
- **SSL/TLS via Cloudflare**: All external traffic is secured using Cloudflare’s SSL.  
- **Reverse Proxy with Nginx**: Minimizes direct exposure of containers to the public internet.

> **Important**: No sensitive credentials or secrets are stored in this public repo. Environment variables and private configurations should remain securely outside version control (using Jenkins credentials, Docker secrets, etc.).

---

## CI/CD with Jenkins

1. **Pipeline Trigger**  
   - Commits pushed to **GitHub** automatically trigger the Jenkins pipeline.  
2. **Build Stage**  
   - Jenkins pulls the latest code and builds Docker images using a `Dockerfile`.  
3. **Test Stage**  
   - Automated tests (e.g., unit, integration) run using tools like **Jest**, **Mocha** or **React Testing Library (depending on language).  
4. **Deploy Stage**  
   - If tests pass, Jenkins pushes the new image to the VPS.  
   - Containers are updated automatically with minimal downtime.

---

## Reverse Proxy Setup

- **Nginx** is configured as a **reverse proxy**, routing incoming requests to the correct Docker container.  
- **Key Benefits**:
  - Simplifies container networking (containers only need internal access).
  - Easier management of SSL certificates through Cloudflare or Let’s Encrypt.
  - Potential for load balancing as the application grows.

---

## Cloudflare Integration

- **DNS Management**: Domain names pointed to the VPS via Cloudflare nameservers.  
- **SSL Certificates**: External traffic is encrypted via Cloudflare’s SSL (flexible or full).  
- **Additional Security**: DDoS protection, caching, and page rules to enhance performance and reliability.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Ansible**: Automate provisioning and configuration management.  
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or the ELK stack for real-time metrics and logs.  
- **Autoscaling**: Potential integration with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm in advanced deployments.
